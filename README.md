##Inspiration
We all know the cost of living in major cities is extremely expensive which is why most find it practical to live with roommates. This keeps costs down as you split bills but since recently moving into an apartment with multiple people, we noticed it is difficult to manage the grocery bill and split things evenly. We knew there should be a better solution than spamming the group chats so we decided to build WeSplit.

##What it does
WeSplit allows users to join groups with their roommates and manage their grocery list together.

##How we built it
We used the Ionic Framework, Angular 2 and Firebase to build WeSplit. 

##Challenges we ran into
We were both new to Angular 2 and the new version of the Ionic framework which complicated things a bit.

##Whats next for WeSplit
WeSplit needs a few more things before we get to help the world manage their grocery lists and expenses.
